Using opencv I have created this one the main concept is 1st ask to access for the video camera then take the 1st frame and store it in a variable by changing it into a numpy array then iterate a loop and in every iteration this loop will take one farme convert it into numpy array and compare it with the initial taken frame if the taken frame is same as the initial frame then their was no motion happened if any change noticed that means change just happend  
Now some little modification is due to little  light variation or very small insect moving is also changing the motion so now I have put the threshold using threshold function which means if the pixel change difference is less than threshold then motion will not be detected if the threshold crossed then the motion is surely detected.
Now Due to little light veriation problem is not resolved so I just take the grayscale image and comparing it using gaussian surface so now the colour changing problem is generally very much solved . 
Now some little change is we are getting the detected motion but it is not directly showing which part is really moved so The detected part must be mapped into the photo so I have taken the green rectangle so that we can detect which part is really changed .
